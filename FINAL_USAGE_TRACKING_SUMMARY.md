# MCP Usage Tracking Implementation - Final Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Double Counting Eliminated** - Removed redundant `/mcp/*` route in `management.ts`
2. **Session-Based Tracking** - First 3 requests within 5 seconds count as only 1
3. **Smart Request Filtering** - OPTIONS and HTML GET requests don't count
4. **Request Deduplication** - Prevents rapid-fire duplicate requests

### How It Works:

```
Connection Flow:
1. Client connects ‚Üí NEW CONNECTION SESSION STARTED
2. Initialize request ‚Üí Counts as 1 ‚úì
3. tools/list request ‚Üí Free (within session) ‚úì
4. resources/list request ‚Üí Free (within session) ‚úì
5. After 5 seconds ‚Üí Each request counts individually
```

### Testing Instructions:

#### 1. Get Your Auth Token
Open browser dev tools on your dashboard and find the Bearer token from any API request.

#### 2. Quick Test with Your Sunny Endpoint

```bash
# Set up environment
export API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export MCP_URL="http://localhost:3000/mcp/sunny-cb8da4b2-fc4f-4329-a381-de7c21e94216"
export AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Check current usage
curl -s -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" "$API_URL/subscription/plan" | jq '.usage'

# Test OPTIONS (should NOT count)
curl -X OPTIONS "$MCP_URL"

# Test HTML page (should NOT count)
curl -X GET -H "Accept: text/html" "$MCP_URL" | head -10

# Test MCP handshake (3 requests = 1 count)
# Request 1: Initialize
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{"tools":true}},"id":1}' \
  "$MCP_URL"

# Request 2: List tools (immediately after)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","params":{},"id":2}' \
  "$MCP_URL"

# Request 3: List resources (immediately after)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"resources/list","params":{},"id":3}' \
  "$MCP_URL"

# Check usage - should only increase by 1
curl -s -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" "$API_URL/subscription/plan" | jq '.usage'

# Wait 6 seconds, then make another request (should count)
sleep 6
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"calculate-bmi","arguments":{"heightM":1.75,"weightKg":70}},"id":4}' \
  "$MCP_URL"

# Check final usage
curl -s -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" "$API_URL/subscription/plan" | jq '.usage'
```

#### 3. Run Full Test Script

```bash
./test_sunny_endpoint.sh
```

This will:
- Prompt for your auth token
- Run all tests automatically
- Show usage after each step
- Provide a summary

### Server Log Messages to Watch:

```
[mcpDynamicHandler] üîå NEW CONNECTION SESSION STARTED
[mcpDynamicHandler] üÜì Connection handshake request 1/3 - COUNTING as 1
[mcpDynamicHandler] üÜì Connection handshake request 2/3 - NOT COUNTING
[mcpDynamicHandler] üÜì Connection handshake request 3/3 - NOT COUNTING
[mcpDynamicHandler] ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIPPING usage tracking for this request
[mcpDynamicHandler] üí∞ Request beyond handshake limit - COUNTING
```

### Expected Behavior:

| Request Type | Usage Count | Reason |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| OPTIONS | 0 | Preflight requests ignored |
| GET HTML | 0 | Info pages don't count |
| First POST (initialize) | +1 | First request in session |
| Next 2 POSTs (within 5s) | 0 | Part of handshake session |
| POST after 5s | +1 | New billable request |

### Files Created:
- `test_sunny_endpoint.sh` - Full automated test script
- `quick_test_sunny.md` - Quick curl commands reference
- `test_curl_commands.md` - Generic test commands

### Why This Matters:
Previously, connecting Cursor MCP client would count 6-8 API calls. Now it counts as just 1, making the usage tracking fair and accurate for actual API usage vs connection overhead.
